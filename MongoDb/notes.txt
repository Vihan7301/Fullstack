Jason file is array[] of objects{}

db.user.find()

$all - and for same key expresion 
$gt - greater than
$lt - less than
$gte -greater 
$lte
$ne - not exist/not equal
$eq - equal
$size -for array size
$regex - regular expression
$in -or for same key expresion
$nin - not or expression for same key


db.users.find().count() - to find no. of documents
db.users.find(username:/name/)- to find any name or surname
db.users.find(username:/*first letter/) - to find letter start
db.users.find($or[{firstName:"Aryan"},{lastName:"Gupta"}]) - or expression for diff. key
db.users.find({firstName:{$in:["Aryan","Sakshi","Vishal"]}}) - or expression for same key

if diff key then diffault is and
if same key then diffoult is or

db.users.find({skills:"Java",skills:{$ne:"Python"}})-- for not take python


mangoDb make shards
And it is multiple shards
Shards are to find diff id's(to divide diff groups)
db.users.aggrigate[]

The functions are :-
 $match -- it work same as find
 $group -- 
 $project --
 &count -- we use it to count of 
 
If we have to find the count in group then we use sum 
And in match we use count

We cant make group of an array (skills) 
$unwind -- is used to break the arrays 



$push-- it save the key in array but duplicate and it is in group, it also take one or more key it 
$$ROOT-- it gives the whaole key  
$addToSet -- it save the key in aaray but not duplicate
 
$group: {
      _id:"$city",
      users:{$push:{
        name:"$username",
        salary:"$salary"
      }}
    }


$addFields -- it make another key in object, it is like function it add another key in it 
$sort -- it sorted ass.(+1) Or diss(-1)
$limit -- it limits the keys in object -- 5 if we have to save only first 5 keys
