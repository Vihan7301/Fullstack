mangoDb make shards
And it is multiple shards
Shards are to find diff id's(to divide diff groups)
db.users.aggrigate[]

The functions are :-
 $match -- it work same as find
 $group -- 
 $project --
 &count -- we use it to count of 
 
If we have to find the count in group then we use sum 
And in match we use count

We cant make group of an array (skills) 
$unwind is used to break the arrays
